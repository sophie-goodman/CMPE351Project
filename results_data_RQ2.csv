50110,"I stayed 2 nights in apartment 1614 and was very pleased. Sam, my host, was cordial, helpful and accomadating. The aprtment is 3X bigger than the hotels I normally stay in in Toronto, with the added bonus of a full kitchen and washer dryer. All this at one third to one half the price. It is very close to all the usual amenities, immediately east of the high end shopping on Bloor street and across the street from the Bloor Yonge subway. I highly recommend this rental and the renters.","host:positive, aprtment:positive, price:positive",-1,1,-1,-1,1,1

Check in was very quick - Sam's associate met us within 10 minutes of arrival and the process of checking out was super easy. I appreciated the flexibility around timing. The apartment was clean, not immaculate, but certainly well taken care of and ideal for our short 2-night stay. The location is great within Yorkville with fantastic restaurants and shopping nearby as well as the subway, grocery, and Starbucks across the street. The apartment is well-amenitized with basic cable, speedy wireless internet, and a washer/dryer (although we didn't use it). The double bed was alright for 2 nights, but I probably couldn't sleep on it any more than that. I would recommend the apartment to anyone looking for an alternative to a hotel.","location:positive, apartment:positive, check in:positive, process of checking out:positive",1,-1,1,1,-1,-1

Too cold to use the backyard space, but would be lovely if it were a bit warmer. The beds are comfortable and we had plenty of bedding, blankets, etc for all.

It is a very vertical house, so not a place for people who have trouble with stairs, but worked fine for us. The house was well set up - with beds all set for the kids and for us.  We happened to be in Toronto during a heat wave, so the a/c was welcome - it isn't real central air but nonetheless cooled the house enough to make sleeping comfortable. Location is great - tons of services and places to eat within easy walking distance. We took the King St streetcar to most attractions and it was easy once we figured out the fare system.

40456,"This apartment is located near the intersection of two very fun neighborhoods - Queen West West and Roncesvalles (name of the street - not sure the name of the neighborhood itself).  I enjoyed these neighborhoods enormously - very funky, ethnic, lots of restaurants, fun shops, etc.  Although the apartment is a distance from downtown, transportation is excellent and very easy.  If you're a walker, this is a great neighborhood to be in.  Denis, the manager, is very responsive - he answers e mails immediately; he was at the apartment when he said he would be; and he is very helpful.  The apartment itself is fine - it's a one bedroom, with a futon in the living room that can be converted into a bed and a very nice deck in the back with a somewhat obstructed view of Lake Ontario - but pretty nice.  It has WiFi.  The apartment could use a few easy upgrades - a small dresser in the bedroom instead of two chairs; a coffee table in the living room; a bigger table in the eat in kitchen; another small chair for the outdoor table.  One item of note is that the apartment is very close to the Gardiner Expressway, which is quite noisy.  When the windows are closed, it's not a problem at all (they seem to be very well insulated), but it did mean I had to close the bedroom window at night. I would actually rate this apartment 4 1/2 stars.  But it is not for everyone.  If you want a place in very funky, fun neighborhood, but not downtown (altho easily accessible to downtown), and are happy with a comfortable, but not elegant place this is a great place to stay at a reasonable price.

He was very helpful and answered all our questions, even mapping out routes for us. The place is very nice, modern, and very clean. It is definitely worth, maybe even more, the price. The bedroom was cozy, the kitchen was fully equipped (pots, pans, spoons), a laundry room was provided and towels in the bathroom too. The deck was amazing in the morning for that first breath of fresh air, or at night when relaxing with some wine and cigars. The place is located a little ways from the heart of the city, but honestly I don't think it mattered...there are streetcars (busses/trolleys) at the end of the black that run very, very frequently and the travel times to the center of the city were very, very reasonable. Parallel to King Street is Queen Street, which we found very much enjoyable to just walk at night and explore. There are tons of cool shops, cafes and bars/restaurants all along Queen St. Even though I really wanted a place in the heart of the city, Denis' unit was very much worth it.

You are really close to roncesvalles, queen street west and Parkdale...all great for food (Check out Easy Restaurant or Parts and Labor just up the street at Queen Street) We cooked most days too and there is a great supermarket about 4 mins walk from the front door.

While staying here you'll discover historical Cabbagetown - almost like a traditional village within the wider city. I loved walking past the many charming Victorian houses in this neighborhood which lead towards the hidden gem that is the Riverdale Farm and Park.

40456,"Denis was a great host who made us feel very welcome. We miscalculated how long it would take us to drive in from Chicago and he waited an extra long time for us. Upon meeting us he was so nice and sympathetic, he promptly showed us the flat and the laundry facility. He even helped us with our luggage which we really appreciated after such a long drive. The flat is cozy and comfortable, the water is hot, the Wi-Fi is fast, the television has dish, and it is probably the best located place I have ever stayed in Toronto. It is on the trolley line but if you are feeling adventurous it is a short walk downtown or to the lakefront. Located on King Street and adjacent to Queen street it is in the artsy/hipster area which pulses with life. The one thing I appreciated the most was that there is Air Conditioning but it was not really needed because there are overhead fans above the beds, the few minutes that we did try the AC, the unit cooled down the temperature very quickly. It was also great to have a nice coffee on the private deck in the morning where you can see the lake peeking through the trees.

There are street car stops really close, like 1 minute walking. You can get it and be in downtown in 25 minutes or so. This street car (504) can take you to line 1 or 2 of the metro.

We took advantage of the exchange rate between the USA dollar and the Canadian dollar. and shopped our socks off.  The two bathrooms came in handy as we were traveling with our daughter and we could get ready separately.   This particular unit was on the 18th floor with very nice urban views.  While the price wasn't cheap, you do get what you pay for.  Storage space is great and the kitchen works well.  The large TV was used to watch the Packers vs the Lions when Brett Favre had his number retired.  It was perfect.  I love the fact that the outdoor terrace had a heater.  The proprietors provide an abundance of towels and all necessities.  The building is a bit older compared to those structures rising up around it and the hallways are a bit dark, but that's my only criticism.

1033162,"Once a month my girlfriend and I, choose to have a staycation, where we spend time at a hotel in downtown Toronto. I decided to try Airbnb for the first time, where I booked this room to stay at, where we were planning to watch game one of the Toronto Raptors basketball game and dinner reservations at a close by restaurant. Upon our arrival, Frank (the owner) made arrangements that our check-in time would be 2pm. While approaching downtown, Frank messaged me at 2pm stating, his cleaner called in sick and that the place was not cleaned from the previous guest. He then said the cleaner would come in a few hours, while we were in the room! Frank also said he was out of town in Niagara and that he couldn't help us out. My girlfriend and I were furious about this situation, as we drove an hour and half to come stay at this Airbnb. As a weekend with one of the worst weather conditions (ice storm), this was extremely frustrating.  The room was filthy from the guest that stayed the night before and we were extremely disappointed and disgusted to spend a minute in this condo. In additon, the pictures posted are extremely misleading of how the place looks, as it is a very small condo, and the bed is a bunk bed.  After discussing the state of the room with Frank, he refused to offer any form of compensation for the inconvenience of this situation and suggested that there were a lot of restaurants around where we could have lunch to kill time until the cleaner arrived and cleans the place. The room already cost $250 and we were planning on going out for dinner later on that night. The fact that he suggested this option was a complete insult. As he had already taken my money and wasn’t considerate of the mistake that happened on his end. My girlfriend and I did not spend a minute in the place and decided to cancel all plans we had in the city and headed back home. We had wasted our time, gas, and were we left with no other option other than head back home. As a first time Airbnb user, I was extremely disappointed and will not be returning back to this unpredictable service again. I would definitely not recommend staying at this location for any future guests.","room:negative, room:negative, dinner reservations:negative, restaurant:negative",-1,0,0,-1,0,-1

Robert had a very helpful inside scoop on some of the good spots around his place. Some people have made comments about the cleanliness of the place and I think it's important to remember going into staying here that it is a lived in AirBnB. By no means is it dirty or messy but someone does live here so it does not have the same presentation as a place that is not someones full time residence. In no way did this take away from our experience. Staying with Robert was also very enjoyable, it was fun to chat with him and at the end of the day a privacy screen was put up to allow more separation at night.

When I arrived there was a little bump as the key was not where I expected it to be, but a kind neighbor of Nadia's actually came over and let me use their phone to call Nadia! She promptly came to the house and let us in! She was also very generous and provided fresh milk, bread, butter, some eggs and anything that was in the house for our use. How I would describe the space is college traveler friendly with clean linens and bedstuffs, fully stocked with almost anything you can think of; for your toiletries and odor prevention activities-->assortment of different sorts of shampoos and body fresh soap, bathroom stocked with toilet paper and Nadia also provided fresh towels and face towels! The space was very user friendly with a mostly stocked and equipped kitchen, although when I was there we were unable to use of one of front stove burners and the oven, but that didn't matter. We were grateful to have a nice kitchen to cook in! We stayed a few days for my cousin's wedding and there was easy access to transportation and a little market where we bought way too much food and did not use it in time for our departure. The neighborhood has a large mixture of different feels; certain parts of New York, New Jersey and Vermont (all places I have been in) and there are quite a few signs in Portuguese and seemingly diverse neighborhood. I felt safe and open to exploring  the area, but was unable to  do as much with activities that had been planned for us. Nadia goes above and beyond as a hostess to make sure we are comfortable, special shout out for her asking about heating because we were still unaccustomed to the colder air in Toronto and her kind care kept us warm and toasty. She even brought us a freshly dried sofa sheet and some champagne glasses from her place. Overall, the feel of the space felt like I was house sitting for a friend who had been gone for a few weeks; overall clean, just a little dusty.

We were celebrating my daughter's birthday, and Emil surprised us with bubbly fruit juice presented in a ice bucket on a silver tray with two wine glasses!  We sat out on the patio and enjoyed the treat.  Emil's gardens are inspiring--creative and beautiful.  Emil was great to work with arranging our visit.

1066718,"Overall it was a great stay! We had some hiccups in the beginning but they eventually were sorted out. I think it was an off weekend for Emil when he accepted our airb&b ( which also made us think why did he accept if it was not a good weekend). He had to attend a last minute funeral out of town and he was trying to coordinate with us a time to check in. He was VERY adamant on meeting up prior to leaving town and would not just give us the code to his keyless lock. We were in town from texas visiting my family and had no cellular reception, just WiFi access , so that was already a barrier. He would ask us what time we needed to check in and when we responded he would reply with a completely different time that worked on his schedule. We went back and forth like this about 3 or 4 times which was super aggravating because we rearranged our plans multiple times to fit his time and without consistent WiFi access it was hard to get instant responses. He finally just gave us the code after hours of back and forth. We then got settled and went out for the night. We came back around 12am and the code given to us earlier was not working...clearly he had changed it without notifying us. Luckily found a WiFi connection nearby and messaged him... He was slow to respond and then eventually gave us the new code. I asked if he had changed it and no response... Then the next day he asked if we were feeling more comfortable now that we knew how to work the lock! The lock only became an issue when he changed the code and didnt tell us! So besides the lock fiasco everything was great! Very cute room and clean. We loved that it had its own bathroom! Its also in such a fabulous location, we walked everywhere and were super close to the tram and subway. So many great coffee shops and bars and restaurants, all minutes away. He also had a cute garden in the back so we sat out there in the morning and drank coffee.

He was responsive to our needs as we settled in, to ensure that we found the backyard comfortable for the kids to play in and that we were okay with everything in the house. He was welcoming to our family who visited us for a meal, even opening up a parking spot for them. Whenever we asked Denis for anything, he obliged with a positive attitude and very timely response rate. We appreciated him very much. We loved staying in this area becusee of the proximity two the beach (there are two ways to get to two different beaches - one more public and one more quiet), High Park, and Roncesvalles.

I used a black sleep mask as it is too bright too early in Toronto during the summer days. The friendly house dog welcomes you with barks but does not bite. The house is century old, and the hardwood floor creaks all the time, even with the lightest steps. This could disturb the other residents. The bathrooms are on lower floors so if you want to use one in the middle of the night make sure you are alert on the stairs. The house location is nice and close to Dufferin station.

The apartment was very clean, but we were only left with 2 sets of towels for the 4 of us....luckily we were able to get two more from a storage cabinet without too much hassle.  We did have a challenge figuring out the parking situation.  It took us a while to find the entry door for the underground garage and then we had to figure out how to get someone to open it for us.  Luckily, the guards at the ground floor entry were able to help us.  The garage itself requires very tight turning as you go down 4 levels to the parking spot (we had a minivan, so this was a bit challenging).  Our next challenge (since we hadn't yet picked up the keys) was getting out of the garage.  We found out that the elevator access requires the key fob which we did not have yet and the parking space is 4 levels below ground and all stairwells have door that lock behind you when you enter them.  We ended up pulling our luggage up the parking garage until we found someone who was able to let us into the elevator bay which got us to the apartment building lobby so that we could finally pick up the keys/key fob.  In terms of getting around Toronto, we were able to walk to almost everything and found the Queen Street street car very easy to use when we went to the Beaches Jazz Festival.  The streets around the apartment felt very safe even when arriving back late at night.

The shower has a decent water pressure and temperature. The main bedroom was very comfortable with a soft but supportive bed and very comfy pillows. My travel companion seemed very happy and comfortable in the den. The gym on the top floor is well equipped. Unfortunately the pool was closed for maintenance during our visit.

The sink in the bathroom didn’t have anything covering the drain and we were forever terrified of accidentally dropping something down there. I had found a skipping rope underneath the mattress when washing the bedding which made me a little uncomfortable. The apartment is filled with spacious cupboards, and allows lots of natural light to enter in the day, which is great in the winter for keeping the apartment warm.

The common garden out back is also a great space. Definitely not a hotel style experience, but with the price, location - and the fantastic host it's a good stay for sure!

My weekend there was the best AirBNB experience I've ever had, hands down. The loft itself is stylish and uber-cute and the location is fantastic with some really cute cafes and restaurants right nearby. Easy access to the unit, and I never once heard the neighbours (although I'd guess that, like me, you'd be spending more time out downtown if you're staying here). The only real caveat I would give is to note that the shower is actually outside of the bathroom (not a surprise in this type of space).

The apartment is a little dark, but we had the door open and it wasn't a problem for us so if you're exploring Toronto in normal times without the two week isolation, you'll be fine. Pape is situated in a beautiful spot with Queen East and all of its wonderful bars and restaurants seconds away. It's also close enough to a few fabulous beaches (great for the summer months) and there is so much to explore there.

406646,Bedroom is nice. There are several other guests staying in the residence but they are all respectful. There is a fridge and 1 shelf should be assigned to you. Parking is 5 dollars daily for a driveway spot. The only problem is that the owner uses the garage for his personal vehicle. You will have to constantly  move your vehicle to allow him to exit the premises. Not the end of the world but important to consider when staying here. No laundry at this residence however there is a nice coin laundry place nearby (2.50 per wash and 2.0 for a dryer). Bring your own toiletries (toilet paper was not included in the washroom). Owner is a nice guy. Friendly and a family man. He lives with his wife and rents out several of the rooms in his house to students/ visiting people.

413276,"Robert’s place was the perfect writing haven for me. He has a great corner workspace next to his wall-to-ceiling windows which look out over the bustling corner of Wellesley and Yonge. There is beautiful ambient lighting throughout the apartment, a well-stocked kitchen if you want to cook, and a lovely fireplace. The bed was very comfortable and the living room is an incredibly cool place to sip coffee or a glass of wine and look down onto the streets below - it’s especially nice at night with the ambient lighting. I dropped my bags off before check-in and was lucky enough to meet Robert and his cute little dog. The apartment is next door to Wellesley station which is very convenient if you need to get around the city.

He sent us very clear and detailed information regarding directions, access to the apartment, parking. laundry, etc. We especially appreciated his very thoughtful information about the neighborhood. The apartment is in the basement of a 3 unit home, but was very quiet and private and is on a lovely residential street.  The apartment was perfect for our one week stay visiting our children in Toronto, and was just as pictured. It is a complete 2 bedroom apartment with a full and very functional kitchen and separate living area with a great television with cable.  It was very clean and cozy and well appointed and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone visiting the area. Speaking of the area, we were in love with the neighborhood. There are markets, cafes, restaurants within steps of the house. There is a huge Loblaw's grocery store and a liquor store within a short walk. The High Park Roncessvalles area is charming and filled with interesting shops, restaurants and ethnic food stores. Gorgeous High Park makes for a lovely walk. We had a car and appreciated the great parking behind the house. We didn't need to use public transportation, but the streetcar is very convenient to the house. Wies was very responsive by email and phone and we could  not have asked for a better host.  His home is truly lovely. ","apartment:positive, parking:positive, house:positive",1,-1,1,-1,-1,-1

The noise does travel through the house, and we regularly heard the folks upstairs but we also had trouble keeping our 4-year-old quiet.

First of all Janet is an amazing person and the best host anybody could wish for. She made us feel very welcome and offered help whenever we needed something. We had great chats and good laughs because she is funny, friendly and lovely. Her house is very cozy and charming. A beautiful apartment with very nice decoration from all the places around the world she's been to, she has great taste for fotography. The bedroom is nice and spacious. The sheets and towels were clean and soft. The bathroom is great and has even warm tiles. She has an adorable garden with an apple tree in the back- just delicious and juicy apples!

The only reason for not giving it a 5 star rating is that it was just a little dustier, with older, more worn furniture compared to most Airbnb's we've stayed in and compared to the photos. The photos are also a bit misleading in terms of the size of the space. They show all the rooms on the first floor, whereas in reality the first floor was limited to the kitchen/living room.

Within a two minute walk are the local variety stores and coffee shop (Hub coffee which we would highly recommend for breakfast)! We did not have a vehicle with us but it wasn't needed as we used the TTC at Ossington station and found it to be very convenient. One small downfall at Ossington station is that there is not an elevator so we carried the stroller down the stairs but it really didn't cause us much grief. We also could've walked to Bathurst status to utilize the elevator but felt the small amount of lifting was more desirable than a longer walk. The kitchen had everything we needed and the bathroom shower (good water pressure) and tub combo was a great help too! We look forward to staying with Holly and Chad again in future!

The Loblaws is only a 15 minute walk and Sobey's is a 10 minute walk. The only negative was how much you could hear what was going on above you. It's fine if you're an early riser (noise usually started after 9AM) but if you want to sleep in, it might be a problem. Other than that, it was a great place to stay! Plus they have two big handsome cats that hang out outside and will let you pet them.","place:positive, bathroom:positive, kitchen:positive, living room:positive, cats:",1,0,1,-1,-1,-1

Its a easy bus to the subway or a 5 minute cab ride that will cost about 8 to 10 bucks. We took this option when we did decide to go out dancing at night. If you are going to Taxi all the way down town to club district or even up town to places like North Toronto it will run you about 25 bucks, which is well worth it if you would like to save some time on your trip back.

For getting around the city, one can take a short bus ride to the subway. Or, what I usually did, one can enjoy a 20 minute walk to the nearest subway station. The immediate neighborhood along Dundas St. West (west of Keele St. and east of Runnymede) has many shops, various international restaurants, and cafes.

As I was flying from overseas, arriving late at night, Pasqua left milk, juices and bear in the fridge, incl. two vegetable muffins (of which I would love to have the recipe...).

Not only did Pascua provide information to us so we could get to the heart of Toronto faster, she also drove us to Union Station to catch our train when we were leaving! And she and I went to St. Lawrence market together the day after we arrived. Her generosity of spirit is in everything she offers to guests. The apartment is cute and comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need- -and then some- -including olive oil, pasta, organic milk, and eggs and cereal, as well as a welcoming bottle of wine. And her place expresses her personality: She has art on the walls that means something to her, and there are interesting books in the bookcase, so you come away with a very warm (read: not corporate) experience. No complaints about anything. And the area is very special. We chose The Beaches because it is just exquisite, with nature, towering trees, and bird song all day long. We didn't have a car, but access from downtown is easy via the 501 Queen Street streetcar to Neville Park (the end of the line). And there were bicycles at our disposal, though we didn't use them. It was lovely to sit at the outside table and drink coffee very early in the morning, before the neighborhood woke up. We are retired senior citizens and always travel with too much luggage, and the stairs going down to the apartment are a little narrow, but we had help getting our suitcases in when we arrived and out when we left. We're planning, hopefully, on staying there next summer, when we return to Toronto.","host:positive, area:positive",1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1

We visited the three farmers markets that were all within walking distance and on the odd lazy afternoon would simply stroll down eclectic Dundas or Queen streets.

In a good location to get anywhere and right next to the park. It was our dream home in Toronto. We were there during an extreme heat wave and that was a bit of a challenge without air conditioning but I don't imagine it would normally be a problem since I have lived in the city for many years without and not usually had a problem.

2171366,Joanne's Loft was absolutely perfect for me. So much so that I extended a one month stay into a three month stay. The loft is Artistic - Designer - Comfortable - Dynamic. The high ceilings and open concept design give the true loft feel of living in a movie set. The Rooftop deck is to die for in the summer. The design elements leave you wanting to explore the space visually and you can never take it all in. Joanne is delightful and on top of every detail. In a three months I never waited for  more then a moment for her to return my emails. I love this loft.. can't wait to come back.,"Loft:positive, stay:positive",-1,1,1,-1,-1,-1
2171366,I absolutely loved Joanne's loft. It is large and open with lots of light. The interior decorating is so interesting and artistic I noticed new elements and touches every day. The two bedrooms are both well appointed and super comfortable. The Kitchen is open concept and great for entertaining and it had all I needed to have several guests over. The dining room table is large and great to work at. A big added bonus is the huge private rooftop deck with a view of downtown Toronto (amazing in the summer). Joanne is a delight and lives downstairs (in the coolest loft ever). She makes herself fully  available by text or email and gets back right away. This loft is wonderfully relaxing to just hang and work in and you could spend your entire stay without ever leaving it - but if you do want to stray the hip Ossington strip of restaurants and bars is just down the block - and it's quick and easy to get right downtown. I stayed in this loft for 2 months and have already booked it for another 2 weeks later this year.

We were a group of 4 and there was tons of room for everyone. One loft bed for two of us, and one main floor bedroom for the other two. There was also a pull out couch that would have slept two more if you are a bigger group. The loft had good solid wi-fi which was a must, as we are gamers. The kitchen was well equipped and we were able to cook some amazing communal meals. Big dining table, dishes, pots, pans -- everything you could want was there. Kitchen basics like oil, sugar, salt were provided. As for booking and checking in, communication with Jose was smooth and picking up the keys was easy. The space was spotlessly clean and ready for us on arrival. If you want a unique space in the west end of Toronto, and you love art then this is the place for you! Would definitely stay here again.

If one was to imagine what an artist loft looks/feels like, apparently this was it. Very modern, clean, and a little funky in terms of layout. My employees commented on the cool artwork, the great natural light, and delicious restaurants in the surrounding area. Although the loft was outside of walking distance from downtown, it certainly served its purpose as my employees had a car and needed to be able to park on the street, which was possible at this location (although there are some time limits for certain parking zones). I would definitely book this loft again.","space:positive, host:positive, space:positive",-1,-1,1,-1,1,-1

We let ourselves in and the place was fantastic! The whole space is covered in art work and it has a really cool vibe. We had 4 in our party and there were 2 beds and 2 air beds. Both the beds and air beds were comfy so no problem there. The apartment had a really nice set up with the breakfast bar kitchen and open living space. We were welcome to use anything in the cupboards so we brewed a few coffees. We spent some time just relaxing in the apartment because it was so nice. Although the place was a little bit out of town we grabbed a street car ($2 for students) into town and it took no longer then 20 minutes, taxi was about $15 and 15 minutes.

It is also very close to streetcar and bus stops so you can get to other parts of Toronto very easily. The apartment itself is nicely decorated and very functional with a solid wifi, a well-equipped kitchen, a washing machine and a dryer. And the TV has Netflix which is a plus. The only possible drawback is that there is no window so if you are a kind of person who needs sunlight, I wouldn't recommend the place. Otherwise it is a great place in a very convenient neighbourhood. Jose is very friendly, quickly responds to inquiries and keeps close contact during the guest's stay.

Maggie, once of the cats, joined me as I settled in to read a book for the first afternoon.  The next day I met Lucille in the kitchen and the three of us sat down for a lively conversation over breakfast (coffee for me).  Then Alan took me to the subway stop with clear instructions on how to get to and from the city.  I bought food and drink in the city at the Lawrence Market, a must see,and that night we cooked dinner together, drank some wine and enjoyed each other's company and stories.  On my last morning, Lucille and Alan and I joined a neighbor to take a walk past a spectacular garden down a steep hill to below the bluffs on the shore of the lake.  Fabulous!

Our toddler is laid back, so while I wouldn’t consider the space toddler proof, it was safe enough for our little guy.  He really enjoyed playing in the long hallway!

The listing is accurate - spacious, filled with plants, and organized.  Some things I wished it had was: more paper towels and an actual like towel for wiping down tables.  It seemed kinda difficult to clean up without sufficient materials like that.  Future guests - please avoid putting stuff on the white work table, for some reason it is highly prone to getting stained - seemed kind of counterintuitive to use it if you're going to get called out for it.  Curtains were a bit difficult to use, since the plants are also right there - risk of knocking them over if you aren't delicate.  While my guest and I had a time staying here, there are some things to be improved upon.  In this listing, there is a noise detection system - however the irony lies in the Sonos speaker that booms like crazy.  It's plugged right next to it.  Again, noise detection by host seem counterintuitive if you've placed a loud booming speaker that can shake walls and have noticeable impact on its surroundings with a noise detector.  Would recommend staying if you enjoy the peace and quiet but a lot of rules to follow.","Host:positive, co/hosts:positive, noise detection system:negative,",-1,-1,-1,-1,0,-1

This was nothing to do with the host, it was apparently Airbnb's 'link' to the host site that failed.  Airbnb refused to refund tye difference back to me.

I would suggest only staying one or two nights most. The air con is very cold and is not controllable by the guests (you can't shut vents or turn on and off and therefore at the mercy of the owners and whether or not they respond to requests). The owner states it should be quiet after 11pm but they themselves are very loud until late and very loud early in the morning. It is clean and has a decent amount of space but aside from that I wouldn't recommend it. It's definitely worth paying more to not have to stay here. That said, I'm sure it'd do someone a night if needed...just don't expect rest.

The view from the room and the gallery is breathtaking and relaxing at the same time! Sleeping to the sound of the lake waves and the wind in the trees and waking up to birdsongs while being in such a big city as Toronto is simply amazing! As a  traveler without a car, I found it quite easy to explore the surroundings and downtown with public transport (several buses are within walking distance).  Lucille and Alan were so welcoming and accommodating, they made me feel at home right away.

The bed is comfy. The bathroom is beautiful. The gardens are lovely. The neighborhood is quiet.

The overwhelming number of positive guest reviews speaks volumes and it doesn't take long to understand and appreciate why the moment you arrive. This is as much a healing home as it is a peaceful idyll, inside and out, perfectly located just outside of the busy downtown area, and made even more special by the fact that Lucille and Alan are just wonderful company. Together, they bring a wealth of experience and local knowledge at the end of the day when you're not out exploring the area's many attractions.

Bluffers Park is a short drive northeast and was my favorite park with paved trails, rolling hills covered with grass, trees, and flowers along Lake Ontario.  The cottage is on a 150' bluff on the edge of Lake Ontario and is a garden park in itself!  Lots of nature to see and enjoy and watch boating activities from the backyard and balcony.

In the flat the bed is super comfy, the appliances are all new, there is a lovely backyard patio.

The main door has a bad lock (or key) that doesn't cooperate often. The host told me to really push that thing in hard to make it work. It did work,  but after 20 days of doing this I have blisters under my index finger. The room itself is very stuffy. To top it off, the decor is a mix of dark black, brown and maroon colors that are borderline suffocating. You could open up the curtains but then your bed is in direct view of the neighboring balcony. I wanted to do an early termination of my stay here, but unfortunately the host did not agree to a refund (which is his right). Overall my suggestion is if you want a comfortable stay, avoid this place.

Most of the storage space was already full, so even though we were staying for a month, we couldn't really put things away and get settled. We had to pay extra for laundry.

I'd recommend this place if you're looking to relax  for a few days or visit with friends in the neighborhood, but not if you're looking to hit the tourist circuit--although there is a direct metro/subway line to downtown it does feel a little removed from the city center. Since I was looking to spend the weekend away from downtown, however, it was ideal and Id consider it again.

The kitchen table is a pub table that had 2 broken flimsy wooden chairs and 2 small chrome stools.  Alex changed the  broken chairs to new stools after my partner told him that it wasn't acceptable to repair the 2 flimsy chairs in our unit.  The kettle that had something gross baked into the bottom of it was also replaced.  The replacement kettle is the only thing in the kitchen that we used.  The other seating in the place is a well-used futon,which is also the second bed.  ALex said that they don't leave bedding for the futon if only 2 people book.  It is advertised as a 2 bed.  What if we were adult brother and sister?  As we walked in, I saw a dirty drain board with a filthy sponge and a mug in it.  The cooking facilities are a  hot  plate with 2 burners and a dirty toaster oven just above the floor. The dishwasher doesn't work. The coffee maker was filthy and we didn't touch it.  The dish soap container was filthy on the outside and had a broken lid.  The liquid bathroom soap container was dirty and there was hair on it.  The shower had mold.  To be fair, we didn't complain to Alex that the place was dirty, though that was very obvious, and the sheets on the bed appeared to be fresh.  $750 for 4 nights for this place was unacceptable.

The house had everything they needed to make them feel at home, and as an added bonus, there were baby items that made staying with a toddler much easier. The rooms are spacious and comfortably furnished, while the rain shower in the airy bathroom was luxurious. The location was also ideal, as both the Yonge Street and Avenue Road strips with their shops, cafes, and restaurants were within a 10 minute walk. Veronique was very friendly and helpful to my parents. While I did not meet her in person myself, it was a pleasure interacting with her as she was always responsive.

Arthur was great, we arranged to have groceries delivered since we were arriving very late a night before a holiday and that was no problem.  And when I contacted him about the last minute possibility of staying longer he was very willing to work with us.  I felt Arthur was quick to respond and available if I needed him, but also felt like we had our privacy in the apartment.  The information he has on his website about local shops and getting around/taxis was very helpful.  Also loved the keycode locks.

2988568,"We had a wonderful experience staying here. The place was great. I somehow had missed that the bedrooms were on a different floor (you walk down a flight of stairs to get to them). Actually worked better for us because of the separation between the grown-ups who stayed awake and talked upstairs while the kids were asleep downstairs, but just thought I would mention it in case stairs are an issue for anyone. The kitchen was very well stocked if you want to cook in. The deck was lovely and we sat out there one afternoon when the weather was nice. We liked the open layout of the kitchen/living area/dining room. We heard some noise from the neighboring apartments when they would go up and down the stairs to their unit, but we only heard it when we were on the main floor, not the bedrooms so it didn't affect sleeping or anything and wasn't a big deal. We had one thing come up while there and texted Arthur. He was super responsive and took care of things right away. The neighborhood was lovely. We ended up taking the street cars a bunch because the kids liked them best and it was a short walk to hop on one of them. We highly recommend the place!

Its a beautiful spacious 1-bed condo, spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed, fully equipped with all linen, cleaning products and kitchen condiments. We were even given a lovely welcome gift of Niagara Wine and a delicious loaf of fruit bread. Tv and internet included, also close to several internet cafes for things like Skype that requires higher data usage. Paul and Patricia were so welcoming, with so much information on the area and city, and were always available to provide advice. They provided a very handy folder full of information! The condo is located on a quiet block off Dundas West, a very safe and pleasant area. It is steps from Chinatown with a great grocery store Lucky Moose that is one of the best value markets that we are yet to locate in downtown Toronto! All in all we couldnt have been more delighted with our choice. We stayed for a full month as we have relocated to Toronto from Ireland and it was the perfect place to allow us to explore the city and so close to public transport (streetcar right outside and only 5mins to the subway). Right next door is the beautiful AGO which is so architecturally beautiful, and Queen Street West is a 10min walk where you'll find some of the coolest shops, bars and restaurants in Toronto.

Frank allowed me use of the space and it was perfect for a morning coffee or evening drink, it’s great being able to step outside without going downstairs! The loft is very large, allowing me to setup a work from home station as well as my PlayStation in separate areas, which is great when trying to unplug from work. There is plenty of storage space for clothes and any other items you may have! I did not use the living room on the 2nd floor much but the dining table is large and has nice big windows. The kitchen is nice. The area is lovely, Bulldog coffee at the end of the street is great, Black Bear Espresso around the corner is good too, lots of food and drink places nearby to meet with friends or grab a nice dinner! The location is right in the downtown so everything you need is available and close which was awesome!! Frank was an amazing host, allowing me my space but being available for whatever may be. His dog Jake was a fun ball of joy, excited to receive pats whenever our paths crossed. Frank communicated quickly/effectively and responded in a timely manner over text. If he was out for an extended period he would give a heads up. Frank was kind enough to do laundry once a week, keeping all the clothes, towels and sheets fresh without having to trek to a laundromat, something which is understatedly awful to deal with. Overall my experience in the loft was lovely, interactions with Frank and Gilles (basement tenant) were always nice and friendly.

The room I reserved doesn’t have a photo at all on the description. When I ask about the room, they said no photos provided. When I got there, the room is small. I wish it could be provided with a photo before people choose to live in this house. Also, it would be better if I know ppl can do the laundry only on Sat/Sun, shower before 10pm such these room rules. I might not choose this one if I could have known the rules before.

The home is a basement level apartment, with its own separate entrance, and just like the review states, you'll see Courtney one time, and then you can text her if u need anything... But make no mistake.  If u need ANYTHING, she is MORE than helpful and attentive to your needs... This was my first time in Toronto, and I wanted to see what the nightlife was about... So I asked her if she knew if any good places... Well Courtney made a few phone calls and I was on the VIP guest list of a party that didn't end til 6 in the morning!!! Other than that, u probably won't need Courtney, as the apartment has EVERYTHING you could possibly want or need... Detergent, toothbrush, dishwashing liquid, soap, towels, dishes, glasses, mugs, etc etc etc!!! The bed is super comfortable as well... The bedroom gets PITCH BLACK when you close the door and turn off the more than adequate lighting (Oh, the lighting!), and is perfect to catch ZZZ's day or night...  Private, cozy, spacious, and gorgeously designed...  Here are just a few things I would change.  The designer leather couch is just a bit worn and small... Also, the tv had just a few channels.  Finally, there is a narrow door length window at the entrance.  I would have liked to see some type of blind or curtain for absolute privacy...The location is absolutely perfect... A 15 minute bus ride from the downtown area... But make no mistake, this is a hotspot all on its own.  Located in the heart of Little Italy, there is a library a stone's throw away, as well as a 24 hour supermarket, the streetcar, and countless clubs, cafe's, pubs, and restaurants (and not just Italian).  There is a subway about a 15 min walk away as well (Ossington station).   For all of this, the price can't be beat!

2592785,"Overall a great location and very safe neighbourhood. However, there are a few things to note. It is an old house so just about every step, stair and door creaks or squeaks, so if you are a light sleeper, this would make it challenging to get a good night's rest. You can basically hear every person coming and going all the time. Also, I did know the room was up two flights of stairs but didn't know it was a very narrow staircase. So you have to be able to carry your luggage in your arms, not just lift your suitcase by the handle.

Pam was away during my stay, but she responded to all of my messages  and made sure that my travel companion and I had everything we needed and more. She provided dependable Wi Fi, clean towels, working appliances in the kitchen, and everything else that you will need for food preparation. There is plenty of refrigerator space for any food that you buy at the markets that are in the neighborhood, or a short walk from the flat. All and all Pam's place is perfect and affordable for anyone's needs during a trip to Toronto.  I have to mention that there are two rooms in the flat not including the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. One of the bedrooms is quite large, with plenty of closet space and places to store other belongings. The other bedroom is much smaller and good for a person who only requires the bare minimums for their bedding space. That being said, the larger room has more than enough space to share the closet for clothing and anything else. Finally, the washer and dryer work fine, and the bathroom is clean and covenient.

The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was stocked with the necessities. I did not see a laundry in the unit but there are laundry mats just around the corner from the house. If you are planning on watching tv or movies make sure you pack a HDMI cord and dvd player/computer as the cable has limited channels.

The living room is a bit small and especially cramped with the addition of a massage chair.  Kitchen window had a ""Do Not Open"" sign on it when we arrived and I was under the impression that Ed fixed it the day after arriving but the sign was never taken off the window, so don't know if he ever returned to fix it.  The day after arriving I asked Ed about the location of the thermostat, he said it was in a unit downstair and it controlled the entire building.  I asked if it was possible to turn it down a bit because it was unbearably hot the night before. He said he would adjust it, but I have a feeling that it was changed back shortly after he left because it was still hot; so we bought a fan at BestBuy to remedy the situation.","location:positive, thermostat:positive, location:positive",1,1,-1,-1,-1,-1

The garden, terrace and swimming pool are most attractive and the pool is immaculately cared for by Paul, a great pleasure to use.

Es gab Handtücher, man konnte seine Wäsche bei Bedarf waschen, ein Bügelbrett und Eisen waren vorhanden, in der Küche gab es Basics wie Tee/Kaffe, Salz, Peffer, Zucker. Eine Mikrowelle war vorhanden  sowie ein Wasserkocher und Toaster. Auch waren das Schlaf und Wohnzimmer mit Fernseher ausgestattet. Die Gegend ist super schön. Besonders empfehlenswert die Scarborough Bluffs (ein Traum) in der näheren Umgebung gibt es reichlich Lebensmittelgeschäfte, Restaurants etc. Toronto erreicht man mit dem Zug in 15-20 min. Die Busse fahren dort 24 Std. Ein kleiner Abzug ist jedoch das man wenn man sich gut fortbewegen möchte definitiv ein Auto braucht. Scarborough ist sehr groß und einkaufen zum Bahnhof fahren etc. Lässt sich eben mit dem auto am Besten erledigen. Auch für die Bluffs und den wunderschönen Hafen, denn dahin fahren keine Busse. Alles in einem wird es schnell nervig wenn man jeden Gang mit dem Bus erledigen muss. Wir haben uns dann auch für einen Mietwagen entschieden und es nicht bereut. Zudem lohnt es sich auch Scarborough zu entdecken und nicht nur Toronto. Wir waren mehr als happy und können die Unterkunft bei längerem Aufenthalt auf jeden Fall empfehlen. Wer nur kurz dort ist sollte sich auf jeden Fall eine Unterkunft direkt in Toronto suchen. Andernfalls verbringt man zu viel Zeit mit der Fahrei bzw.

3315154,"What a nice gem in the outskirts of the downtown centre.  When looking for a place, my fiance and I wanted to be in a safe area, a private space that had another area to relax besides the bed, something walkable to downtown, close by to amenities, and convenient parking. Robert's place encompassed all of those features.  We had a very easy check-in.  We arrived in the evening and Robert happened to be home since it was the big Raptors' championship game.  He offered help in bringing our things down the stairs.  He also gave great suggestions on where to find a place to watch the game close by since he knew that most places would be packed.  The stairs, as other reviewers have said, is a spiral staircase and can be narrow for some, but we didn't have much trouble even though we brought large bags and a suitcase since my family has similar stairs and we were already used to them.  The suite is very spacious and has a large TV, couch, coffee maker, fridge, and a bathroom with a large shower and rainfall shower head (he should include pictures of the bathroom/shower!).  A nice touch was his references (brochures, local restaurants/activities/happenings). His home is in a safe neighborhood with many restaurants just steps away.  There's even a late-closing Shopper's near by.  We loved how his home was very accessible to downtown, but just far enough from the traffic and craziness since we were there at such a busy time (Raptors winning the NBA championship!).  The neighborhood itself is very quaint and historic.  Overall, Robert's place is great, the only negative thing was the bed because it probably won't accommodate taller people, so just inquire if you have concerns on this.  Robert was a great host.  He was very responsive to messages and checked to make sure we were having a good stay (and not in an intrusive way).  He even let us use his parking spot past check-out time.  Highly recommend Robert's home!","host:positive, place:positive",1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1

Anyone with mobility issues should be aware of this since it could be a very real health hazard. The advertisement for this place stated that there was an indoor fireplace. No such thing. There was however, and electric space heater that did help warm the space up well. To say there is no kitchen is rather of an understatement. Washing of dishes needed to be done in the bathroom since there is no other sink available except for a laundry tub which is in an unheated area of the house. Not a big problem for us since, as campers, we are used to improvising. Robert has equipped the area with a couch that, in itself, is worth the rental.

3315154,"I can’t write enough good things about Robert and his charming place in Cabbagetown. I originally booked a stay in April, but when Toronto increased their COVID lockdown restrictions, I got nervous about coming to the city. Robert was more than accommodating; he offered me an excellent price and even moved my trip to a future date! I booked a weekend in June when I figured restrictions would be more relaxed and I got lucky because they lifted literally the day before my trip. Check in was a breeze and Robert even accommodated an early check in. The automated lock makes it easy to enter and leave. While I didn’t meet Robert in person, he checked in on me via Airbnb and was always quick to respond to my messages. The staircase leading down to the apartment is very tiny, so pack small bags. The space itself is airy and well lit, despite being a basement. There isn’t much natural light, but there are plenty of high hats to make it feel light. The entire space was super clean and very comfortable, including the bed and couch.  Be patient with the hot water, this is a home from the 1800s after all!  There was a parking space for my car and the Backyard is absolutely darling and perfect for a morning cup of coffee. The neighborhood is so charming, I got a delicious breakfast sandwich from Epicure and a VERY affordable mocha latte from Jetfuel 2 minutes away. I can’t wait to come back to Toronto and to stay with Robert again in the future. If you have a chance, definitely stay here.","place:positive, price:positive, neighborhood:positive",1,-1,-1,-1,-1,1

Dundas St and Queen St are also both really close to the property and they both run 24 hour street cars (Canadian for Trams…), so getting in and out was easily done via public transport.

I am a sensitive sleeper and was never awoken by it.  Catherine's attention to detail and communication was top-level throughout from start to finish --- and she was traveling out of country during my stay.  Although it does not have an official living room the bedroom is large and the kitchen is open and spacious and has a cozy atmosphere to cook/eat or to do work at the kitchen table if you wish.

I was attending the Society of Animation Studies conference and wanted a place to stay with like minded creative people. Gisele and Archer were perfect hosts. Relaxed, welcoming and interesting, with endless useful insights into the local and wider areas. Gisele gave a clear local map with useful places to check out! I was able to come and go freely without any worries or concern. The place is in easy walking distance of Little Italy, Kensington Market and all the Queens Road West at cafes and bars. But most of all near to the streetcars, the 501 on the Queens West runs all night and as a woman on my own I had no worries at all being at a conference right down on the Lakeshore, going out and about and getting home safe. Toronto is a great place to visit... and there's tons to do and see. As a great momento check out Lynn Golding on the streets of Kensington Market at the weekend, she makes fantastic prints of her meticulously researched and hand drawn mandalas of Toronto districts and history! I got one of the Queens West. All in all this was the best of experiences.

The unit is in a great area, with a good collection of bars, restaurants, grocery and convenience stores, and shopping at its front door.

The room is well-equipped and designed to host and accommodate all your needs. The private bathroom is such a great plus. It felt so good to have a family host supporting our family needs. We had toys, baby equipment that Gisele was more than happy to share. We even had problems getting some Canadian Dollars and Gisele was more than glad to lend us some cash till we get some money.

Ethan was very communicative and even checking in with me when our Fellow's plane was late and he hadn't heard from him yet.  It made check-in and check-out as easy as possible.

The apartment is exactly as it is in the pictures, only the view is even more breathtaking!! We spent a lot of the time in the mornings and evenings chilling on the balcony enjoying the view!! The bed is super comfy and there is lots of wardrobe space for hanging up clothes etc. The kitchen is great and is fully equipped with cooking essentials and utensils. The apartment was spotlessly clean too, and the garbage shoot is just down the hall which was also really handy! There is a gym in the building too which was great also. The apartment is in an excellent location to explore the city.... There are many great restaurants and bars close to the apartment.

Du coup, c'est un peu loin du principe d'airbnb où l'on rencontre son hôte, on partage sur la ville à visiter... là, à aucun moment on ne le vois, il ne répond que très succinctement aux demandes par email, il précise dans son règlement intérieur qu'il ne faut surtout pas dire à la réception de l'immeuble qu'on a loué l'appartement mais qu'on est un de ses amis... ce qui laisse présager qu'il loue sans déclarer... il n'y a aucune information touristique dans l'appart, ni aucune indication pratique (où se trouvent les poubelles, où est le supermarché le plus proche...). Nous avons loué beaucoup d'appartements avec airbnb et nous regrettons quand nous avons affaire à ce genre de loueur qui ne fait ça que pour l'argent.  Le jour du départ, l'appartement n'étais pas loué, mais nous avons dû attendre la veille afin que Thomas nous ""autorise"" de rester jusqu'à 14h au lieu de 11h (car, comme il le dit, il doit le louer absolument)... il faut préciser que nous avions loué deux semaines pour presque 1000€... L'appart est, de plus, loin du centre ville et il faut vraiment marcher.

The unit was small but perfect for the two of us.  Very nice building with great amenities.  Too cold to use the roof top pool but I imagine it would be great on a hot summer day.

If you must go bring flashlights,  and check that the stones are cemented and will not flip on you and cause injury.  I would buy a $10 shower head from the hardware store and install it yourself.

(I am aware this is a matter of personal taste) The flat feels a bit dungeon-like because of the lack of light in the corridor. The area is a good location - easy access to downtown and Queen St which is very cool. The bed was big. The cats were lovely to have around. The main down points for me were the keys were old and so it was difficult working the lock for the front door, there was no living room space and the main issue was that the place seemed packed with other air bnb guests. This made it feel like a kind of shared student house. Twice people walked into my room by accident.

Jordan was great — conversational if you wanted but also private if you wanted that, too. The shower was great. The huge bed was great. The A/C — specifically noting this because there is a review here that complained about it — could make the room as frigid as a morgue. Plus, there's a Zipcar lot a few houses down.

Also, sharing the bathroom and kitchen (handy: soap and tea/coffee provided) never delivered line ups.

There's also 2 really nice parks that are only a 5-10 walk away. As a solo female traveller, I felt safe walking around the area. I picked this listing for both the location and amenities, and I was not disappointed! I ended up having the Air BnB alone to myself. Heating in the basement was excellent and I was never cold. Street is really quiet at night. The only noise I heard were some walking around from the next door neighbors. Kylie was accommodating when I asked for an earlier check in and always responded to my inquiries within an hour. I appreciated the self-check in aspect and it was very easy to follow. I stayed at Kylie's listing for 5 days and felt right at home! The only thing to note is that there is a lot of stairs, and the kitchen, main bathroom, and washer/ dryer are on the third floor.

The room itself has no windows to the outside but (milky) skylights to the entry hallway/living room. Thereby it's hard to properly air the room and currently it does not have any curtains so it is not possible to get the room completely dark when the light is on in the other rooms which it mostly is because other guests need it to navigate the stairs.

Everyone in the house was extremely friendly and welcoming and made us feel at home. They are generous beautiful souls that made our trip to Toronto a great experience, not only because of the trip itself but also because they gave us the opportunity to become part of their community while we were there. They shared an amazing meal with us the last day, they let me use one of their bikes, discussed with us their beautiful vision of the world and recommended us  incredible places to eat (including the vegetarian festival that was happening while we were there).

The apartment was super cozy and had everything we needed, including a well stocked pantry.

Location was super convenient as Loblaws was just down the street and there are many restaurants a few blocks away as well. Wei Li is a super responsive and friendly host and responded quickly and efficiently to our needs throughout our stay, making us feel very welcomed in the city and were super efficient in helping us solve some issues that we ran into during our stay at the apartment, such as lights going out etc. However, the thermostat and heating system can get slightly noisy at times,but it’s understandable and we got used to it after some time.","location:positive, neighbourhood:positive, hosts:positive, place:positive",1,-1,-1,-1,1,-1

The kitchen is not equipped for more than drinks and take out.  There was cutlery and glasses. No dishes, plates, bowls, serving platters.  I ran out and bought disposables. I spent an hour cleaning before the others arrived because of dust and sticky table surfaces.  There was a dirty kitchen towel hanging on the oven door, the oven was dirty, the fridge had spills inside. For these reasons I think I paid too much.

My parents slept in the other queen bed and said it was slightly uncomfortable because the mattress was sunken but there was no complaints from my relatives who slept in the King or the couch.

3703115,"This is a great location and a nice place to stay. We were at a conference at the conference center and the location was super convenient for that as well as comfortable for our research team to be able to stay and work together. The only problem is that we booked for 8 guests and were only given one set of keys to use. With the large group attending a conference and having very different schedules, this caused huge issues for us.  And since we were coming from the US, not everyone had international plans on their phones, causing further issues in coordinating access. The host did get us a second set of keys on day 3 of our visit, but only the fob worked, not the key to the door. While we made it work, this key issue was a major inconvenience and an issue for our group. It was also disappointing that the host didn't do more to help with the issue and in fact, suggested that it was my fault for not having requested an extra key up front.","location:positive, place:positive, place:positive",1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1

It is on the subway line and other public transport and there is also street parking provided which is a plus in Toronto as parking can be pricey.   A minor point of note, there is a lovely pear tree in the middle of the garden which during most of the year is probably a real plus but in September is loaded with fruit which makes using the patio difficult due to the fruit falling and the insects this attracts.  It was cleaned daily by Nedo  but the scale of the fruit fall is immense.  As there is no eating area internally this is the most likely place to have dinner which was not really usable during this period and would be a consideration if planning to spend a great deal of time in the garden.
